      <title>Colima, Dojo and the end of Docker Desktop</title>

      <description>We wrote this post because of the recent update to the Docker Desktop licensing. Dojo, a CLI tool that we wrote, uses Docker and Docker-Compose. As many organisations are moving away from Docker Desktop, we&amp;rsquo;d like to help you continue using Dojo while staying compliant with the licenses. The proposed solution focuses on Colima.
Are licence updates applicable to you? First, if you use Docker on Linux, this situation does not concern you (see: source).</description>

      <title>Getting AWS SysOps Administrator certified</title>

      <description>In July 2019, I&amp;rsquo;ve passed the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate. I decided to share my experiences leading to it, because while there is a lot of resources for learning AWS, choosing the time-efficient ones requires some extra effort. While I am not an expert in AWS (with just one certificate), my learning path was quite smooth. I learned a lot in a short time, then passed the exam with a high score of 973/1000, which is what many people could aim for.</description>

      <title>GoCD configuration validation with preflight API</title>

      <description>In GoCD 19.2.0 preflight API endpoint was merged, which allows to validate local GoCD configuration files (e.g. YAML, JSON) before submitting them to source control.
Every user has been long annoyed by slow feedback, when pushing configuration changes to GoCD only to find out in a moment that something is wrong on the errors and warnings page. This required to ammend last commit or push another one.
With the new API and gocd-cli it is now possible to get the same feedback before pushing changes.</description>
