      <description>In GoCD 19.2.0 preflight API endpoint was merged, which allows to validate local GoCD configuration files (e.g. YAML, JSON) before submitting them to source control.
Every user has been long annoyed by slow feedback, when pushing configuration changes to GoCD only to find out in a moment that something is wrong on the errors and warnings page. This required to ammend last commit or push another one.
With the new API and gocd-cli it is now possible to get the same feedback before pushing changes.</description>
